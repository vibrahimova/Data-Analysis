# Data Analysis with Power BI
## Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

****The problem****

The problem that I worked on in this project is customer churn. I used a fictitious churn dataset from a Telecom provider called Databel. My main aim was to analyze why customers are churning, or in other words, leaving Databel.

### Data Overview
The dataset consists of 29 different columns and has one row per customer. I analyzed a snapshot of the database at a specific moment in time, meaning there is no time dimension.
The dataset contains numerous dimensions, the first one being Customer_id. The Customer_id is a unique ID that identifies an individual customer. The second column is called Churn Label, and it indicates if a customer churned with "Yes" and "No" labels. The dataset contains various other dimensions, such as demographic fields and information about premium plans.
The dataset contains more than just dimensions, so let's look at some measures. The Total Charges column, for example, takes the sum of all monthly charges billed to a customer.
